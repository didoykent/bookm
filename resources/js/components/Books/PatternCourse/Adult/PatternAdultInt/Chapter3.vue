    <p>
      <i><b>Reported Speech</b></i> is what we use if we want to share with another person
      a conversation we had in the past. We always change the main verb
      of the original message to its simple past form. The most common reporting verbs that we can use are
      <b><i>told, said,</i></b> and <b><i>asked.</i></b>
    </p>

    <p><v-container grid-list-md text-xs-left>
      <v-layout row wrap>
        <v-flex xs12>
          <v-card light color="#f6eec7">
            <v-card-text class="px-10">
              <center>
                If we are going to use <b><i>told</i></b> in the reported speech, we need to have the object (me, you, her). However, if we use
                <b><i>say,</i></b> we don’t need to have the object.
              </center>
            </v-card-text>
          </v-card>
        </v-flex>
      </v-layout>
    </v-container>
  </p>

  <p>
    Examples
  </p>

  <p>
    <i>
    Message: Mother said, “If you study hard, you will get good grades.”<br />
    Reported Speech: Mother told me that if I studied hard, I would get good grades.
    </i>
  </p>

  <p>
    <i>
    Message: “Where are you going?”, Amy asked John.<br />
    Reported Speech: Amy asked John where he was going.
    </i>
  </p>

  <p>
    But, we can use Present Tense if the statement is still happening or thought to be happening in the present.
  </p>
  <p>
    This way, you don’t need to change the main verb of the original sentence.
  </p>
  <p>
    Example
  </p>
  <p>
    Message: June said, “I am sick.”<br />
    Reported Speech: June said that she is sick. (It means even until now June is still sick.)

    B: Oh, it's okay. It’s not your fault anyway, but did he ever tell you why he tried to visit me?
  </p>
  <p>
    A: He said that he would just come back here tomorrow to see you in person. And oh, he also told me, you could call him if you have got his message.
