    <p>
      How do we talk about a routine we had in the past in English? One of the easiest ways to do that is to use the verb <b><i>used to.</i></b>
      There are a lot of instances wherein we need to narrate a habit we did in the past; this usually happens when we are trying to let a person get to know us better.
    </p>

    <p><v-container grid-list-md text-xs-left>
      <v-layout row wrap>
        <v-flex xs12>
          <v-card light color="#f6eec7">
            <v-card-text class="px-10">
              <center>
                <p>
                  Often, we use the conjunction <b><i>when</i></b> in our sentences.<br />
                  Notice that after the phrase <b><i>I used to,</i></b> the verb takes its base form.
                </p>
              </center>
            </v-card-text>
          </v-card>
        </v-flex>
      </v-layout>
    </v-container>
  </p>

  <p>
    Examples
  </p>

  <p>
    <i>I used to go to school.<br />
       I used to study.
    </i>
  </p>

  <p>
    <i>When I was younger, I used to drink milk.<br />
       When I was still in my university, I used to play football.
    </i>
  </p>

          <v-card-text class="px-10">
            <center>
              <p>
                However, for actions that we never really did in the past and until now, we use <b><i>I didn’t</i></b><br />
                <b><i>use to</i></b> or <b><i>I used to.</i></b>
              </p>

  <p>
    A: It is really hard if you are now in the end days of years.
  </p>
  <p>
    B: I guess you’re correct there my friend. There are a lot of things we’ve been missing.
  </p>
  <p>
    A: Especially the old days.
  </p>
  <p>
    B: I used to go out and stay in different sports clubs late at night.
  </p>
  <p>
    A: I used to travel to different places, and to different countries. But, since our health is getting on the way, we hardly do that now.
  </p>
  <p>
    B: I used to engage in several sports before. I even became one of the top players in baseball, but now, even getting up in the morning takes a lot of effort.
  </p>
  <p>
    A: Going out to enjoy and be with our friends was totally easy those days.
  </p>
  <p>
    B: And I guess we can’t do anything about that anymore.
